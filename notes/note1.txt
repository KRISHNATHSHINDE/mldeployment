1. 
Anaconda prompt
code . --> opens vs code
create an environment --> conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
to activate --> conda activate venv/
clone our GitHub repo by following the steps just after we create a repo on site:
git init
create README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/krishnaik06/mlproject.git
git push u origin main

create .gitignore in repo from site
to update in vs -> git pull

create setup.py and requirements.txt  
setup.py --> resp for createing app as a package
write the basic code in setup.py:

from setuptools import find_packages, setup
setup(
name = 'mldeployment',
version='0.0.1',
author='krishnath',
author_email='krishnathshinde47@gmail.com',
packages=find_packages(),
install_requires=['pandas','numpy','seaborn']
)

create a folder named src and __init__.py in it.
this folder is the main working folder

we update the setup.py so that it can read and install from requirements.txt
-e . runs the setup.py automatically

Now we can run pip install -r requirements.txt
